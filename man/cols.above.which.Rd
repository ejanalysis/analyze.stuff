\title{Does each Column have a Value at or above Cutoff}
\usage{
cols.above.which(x, cutoff, or.tied = FALSE, below = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data.frame or matrix of numbers to be compared to cutoff value.}

\item{cutoff}{The numeric threshold or cutoff to which numbers are compared. Default is arithmetic mean of row. Usually one number, but can be a vector of same length as number of rows, in which case each row can use a different cutoff.}

\item{or.tied}{Logical. Default is FALSE, which means we check if number in x is greater than the cutoff (>). If TRUE, check if greater than or equal (>=).}

\item{below}{Logical. Default is FALSE. If TRUE, uses > or >= cutoff. If FALSE, uses < or <= cutoff.}
}
\value{
Returns a logical matrix the same size as x.
}
\description{
Flag which cells are at or above some cutoff.
}
\details{
For a matrix with a few cols of related data, find which cells are at/above (or below) some cutoff.
Returns a logical matrix, with TRUE for each cell that is at/above the cutoff.
Can be used in identifying places (rows) where some indicator(s) is/are at/above a cutoff, threshold value.
}
\note{
Future work: these functions could have wts, na.rm, &
allow cutoffs or benchmarks as a vector (not just 1 number), & have benchnames.
