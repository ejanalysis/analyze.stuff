#' Table of counts of integer values zero through maxbin
#' @description Like tabulate or table, sort of, but includes zero unlike tabulate,
#'   and lets you ensure results include every integer 0 through maxbin,
#'   so you can for example easily combine tables of counts where some
#'   did not include all integers.
#' @details When using a dataset like EJScreen with 12 indicators of interest,
#'   and counting how many of the 12 are above various cutoffs,
#'   there may be zero rows that have exactly 8 above some cutoff, for example.
#'   This function makes it easier to combine those tables into a summary
#'   where 0-12 are in each table while table() would only return integers
#'   that came up in a given case (for one cutoff).
#' @param x vector of integers, like counts, that can include 0
#' @param maxbin highest integer among x, or number of bins
#' @seealso colcounter_summary()
#' @return summary table
#' @export
#'
tablefixed <- function(x, maxbin=NULL) {
  # returns a table of counts of integer values zero through maxbin
  maxvalue_or_1 <- max(1, x, na.rm = TRUE)
  if (is.null(maxbin)) {maxbin <- maxvalue_or_1}
  if (maxbin < maxvalue_or_1) stop('invalid maxbin - some values are larger')
  mycounts <- tabulate(x, nbins = maxvalue_or_1)

  zerocount <- sum(x == 0, na.rm = T)
  abovemaxcounts <- rep(0, maxbin - max(1, x, na.rm = T))
  x <- c(zerocount, mycounts, abovemaxcounts)

  names(x) <- 0:(maxbin)
  return(x)
