#' @family functions for above and below
#' @seealso \code{\link{count.above}} \code{\link{pct.above}} \code{\link{pct.below}} to see, for each column, the count or percent of rows that have values above or below a cutoff.
#' @seealso \code{\link{cols.above.count}} \code{\link{cols.above.which}} \code{\link{cols.above.pct}} to see, for each row, the count or which or fraction of columns with numbers at/above/below cutoff.
#' @note Future work: these functions could have wts, na.rm, &
#' allow cutoffs or benchmarks as a vector (not just 1 number), & have benchnames.
